                    <p>The Grove* IoT Commercial Development Kit will provide you with a hardware and software stack to prototype and build Internet of Things services.</p>
                    <p>It comes with a IoT gateway which is an intermediate device between sensors, actuators and your corporate network or the cloud. The gateway allows you to efficiently collect and securely transport data from devices, remote users, and
                        applications to serve your particular IoT application.</p>
                    <p>It also comes with a starter pack of sensors. These sensors were put in the starter kit because they are commonly used in IoT projects. However, there are many other types of sensors that can be used with the Intel® IoT Gateway. The
                        libupm sensor library current supports more than 300 types of sensors and actuators.</p>

                    <p>The Arduino 101* board have been designed in collaboration with Intel. We use the Arduino 101* board because it offers easily-accessible pins for IoT sensors or the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit,
                        which is described below, and simplifies connection to them—you can easily attach your sensors to the Arduino 101* board and start communicating with them. The module contains two tiny cores, an x86 (Intel® Quark™ Compute Module)
                        and a 32-bit ARC core, both clocked at 32MHz. The Intel toolchain compiles your Arduino sketches optimally, across both cores, to accomplish the most demanding tasks.</p>
                    <p>The Arduino 101* comes with the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>14 digital input/output pins (four of which can be used as PWM outputs)</li>
                        <li>Six analog inputs</li>
                        <li>A USB connector for serial communication and sketch upload</li>
                        <li>A power jack</li>
                        <li>An ICSP header with SPI signals and I<sup>2</sup>C dedicated pins</li>
