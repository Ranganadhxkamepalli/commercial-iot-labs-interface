                    <p> The Intel® IoT Developer Hub is a web-based service running on the gateway that allows you to have a hands-on sensor-to-cloud experience in a very short time period. It has built-in tutorials to teach you about tools like the
visual programming interface called Node-RED* and the Wind River Helix App Cloud, including sample code to develop the app in the cloud.
The Intel® IoT Developer Hub provides ways to easily manage the administrative settings of the gateway.
The Intel® IoT Developer Hub lets you, as the developer, add packages and
develop your apps. When development is complete, you can save a hardened OS image onto a USB flash drive.</p>

                  <p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Connect gateway with Helix App Cloud</li>
                        <li>Create graphical view of Sensor data </li>
                        <li>Access repositories and manage packages on gateway</li>
                        <li>Access Gateway Administration tools and resources</li>
                        <li>Getting Familiar with Cloud Commander</li>

                    <p>Create a deployable OS Image for production use based on the OS and software running on this gateway.</p>
                      <p>The deployment OS image includes all applications, data files, and OS updates from the running gateway, but changes can be made to the OS settings and some configuration files to harden the OS to provide better security in a deployment environment.</p>
                      <p>The OS image is hardened and saved to a USB drive while leaving the development gateway OS unchanged.</p>
                      <p>The replicated image can quickly be deployed onto another system for evaluation & testing. This enables validation of an IOT system prior to field deployment.</p>
