Using trusted directories
You can override the protection applied to a system using trusted directories. After you add directories
as trusted directories, systems can run any software present in these directories.
On the Windows platform, Application Control tracks files and blocks the execution of binaries and
scripts on the network directories. Application Control also supports tracking files on the Server
Message Block (SMB) mount points. This feature is identified as network‑tracking in the features list.
By default, this feature is enabled and prevents the execution of binaries and scripts on network
directories.
When this feature is disabled, execution of scripts on network directories is allowed. However,
execution of binaries on network directories is not allowed. Also, write‑protecting or read‑protecting
components on a network directory is not in effect.
What are trusted directories
On a protected system, you can add directories (local or network share) as trusted directories to run
any software present in these directories. Trusted directories are identified by their Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) path.
When do I add trusted directories
If you maintain shared folders containing installers for licensed applications on the internal network in
your organization, add trusted directories for such network shares.
When enabled, Application Control tracks files over network shares and blocks their execution until the
network share is added as a trusted share. Application Control also prevents protected systems from
executing any code residing on a network share.
Additionally, if needed, you can also allow the software located at the UNC path to install software on
the protected systems. For example, when logging on to a Domain Controller from a protected
system, you will need to define \\domain‑name\SYSVOL as a trusted directory (to allow execution of
scripts and binaries).
Add trusted directories
Add directories as trusted directories to run any software present in these directories on a protected
system. You can specify the absolute or relative path (on Linux only) to one or more directories. You
can also specify paths to the directories located on network shares.
