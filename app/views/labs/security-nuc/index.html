                    <h5>Lab Overview</h5>

                    <p>The Intel Iot Gateway provides a McAfee layer that lets you configure McAfee embedded products for the Wind River Linux target platform. McAfee® Embedded Control for the Intel® Security product offering—maintains the integrity of your system by only allowing authorized code to run and only authorized changes to be made to a system. It automatically creates a dynamic whitelist of the “authorized code” on the embedded system. Once the whitelist is created and enabled, the system is locked down to the current, known good baseline and no program or code snippet outside the authorized set can run and no unauthorized changes can be made. McAfee® Embedded Control (MEC) provides the following capabilities in Wind River Linux platforms:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>code and application protection, which only lets whitelisted programs (binary executables, scripts) run. Any program that does not appear in the whitelist cannot run. This stops malicious programs from installing and functioning on the system.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>tamper proofing for whitelisted programs so the files cannot be modified on the disk, directories or volumes</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>dynamic whitelisting, which eliminates the need to manually maintain the inventory list of authorized applications. This features let you manage and update whitelisted files.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h5>1. Exploring McAfee® Embedded Control</h5>

                <p>In this section you will explore how McAfee® Embedded Control integrates into Wind River Linux and how MEC manages the inventory of executables, configurations, operating modes and logging.</p>

                <p>On the Intel Iot Gateway, open a terminal window and execute the following command to confirm that the McAfee® Embedded Control (MEC) rpm is installed:</p>
                <pre><code># rpm -qa | egrep solidcore&#13;&#10;solidcores3-6.6.0_145-r0.0.intel_baytrail_64</code></pre>
                <p>You should see the name of the Solid Core rpm appear. This verifies that it is installed.</p>
              </div>

              <div content-block name="security-features-list" message="Verify features of McAfee® Embedded Control Exercises">

                    <p>Next let's verify which version of McAfee® Embedded Control is installed on your gateway</p>
                    <pre><code># sadmin features list&#13;&#10;MEC Essential</code></pre>
                    <p class="alert alert-info">If you see MEC Essential installed, then you have the minimal McAfee® Embedded Control installation.  This version has a reduced feature set and is available with the free version of your Wind River Linux operating system.</p>

                    <p>Next let's next verify which features are enabled with your version of McAfee® Embedded Control</p>
                    <pre><code># sadmin features list&#13;&#10;checksum&#9;&#9;Enabled&#13;&#10;integrity&#9;&#9;Enabled</code></pre>
                    <pre><code>sadmin features</code></pre>

                    <p>Note the following aspect of the MEC features:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                          <p>The feature <strong>integrity</strong> Based on your setup, Embedded Control gives you the flexibility to configure access to the protected systems. You can lock down systems to prevent even administrators from changing what is authorized to run on a system, unless presented with an authentication key.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>checksum</strong> With this release, we have added support for SHA256 to calculate checksum values of inventory items. SHA256 offers improved security as compared to SHA1. Although we continue to support SHA1, checksum values of inventory items will be calculated using SHA256. If you use SHA256 as the hash algorithm, we compute both SHA1 and SHA256 values while creating the whitelist. However, decision making is primarily based on SHA256 values.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>The feature <strong>script-auth</strong> is like deny-exec, but for scripts - only whitelisted scripts file can execute.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>The feature <strong>deny-write</strong> provides tamper-proofing to protect data file ( for example configuration file). Unlike the deny-exec and script-auth features (which rely on a whitelist), the deny-write feature is rules-based. The MEC configuration file (solidcore.conf) records the rules.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>The feature <strong>deny-read</strong> provides tamper-proofing to prevent reading of critical files. The feature <strong>deny-read</strong> is alos rule based (like deny-write) - The MEC configuration file (solidcore.conf)
                              records the rules. The feature is disabled by default.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In this section you will generate an initial whitelist, enable MEC, and restart the McAfee solidifier service.</p>

                    <p>Dynamic whitelisting is a core feature of MEC. The whitelist (or inventory) enumerates the set of programs (called authorized or solidified program code) that are allowed to run on the host computer. Any programs not in the whitelist are considered unauthorized - they cannot execute, and MEC logs their failed attempt to execute. Whitelisting does not change the files listed in the inventory.</p>

                    <p>As the MEC administrator, execute the following command to create the initial whitelist.</p>
                    <pre><code>sadmin solidify /bin /boot /etc /lib /lib64 /opt /root /sbin /usr /www</code></pre>

                    <h5>Lab Overview</h5>

                    <p><b>GRSecurity</b> is a set of software patches released under the GNU GPL for the Linux kernel to enhance the system security. It allows the system administrator to, among other things, define a minimum privilege policy for the system,
                        in which every process and user have only the lowest privileges necessary to function. GRSecurity has 2 primary features, the RBAC (Rules Based Access Control) and the PaX.</p>
                    <p><b>gradm</b>, the administration utility for the role-based access control system, is a powerful tool that parses your ACLs (Access Control Lists), performs the enforcement of a secure base policy, optimizes the ACLs, as well as handles
                        parsing of the learning logs, merges them with your ACL set and outputs the final ACLs.</p>


                    <h5>Disable McAfee® Embedded Control</h5>

                    <p>By design, <b>McAfee® Embedded Control</b> will protect your system from changes. So let's turn it off now.</p>
                    <pre><code># sadmin disable</code></pre>

                    <h5>The gradm command</h5>
                    <p>gradm is the grsecurity RBAC administration and policy analysis utility. It allows you to configure and administrate the grsecurity system.</p>
                    <p>To display all available command-line switches, run gradm --help.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm</code></pre>

                    <h5>Setting up a Role-Based Access</h5>
                    <p>Here we will create three roles <b>root</b>, <b>admin</b>, <b>shutdown</b>. Each of these roles will have unique abilities that will be constrained by the by RBAC. You can use any password that you like for each role.</p>

                    <h5>Enable Learning Mode</h5>
                    <p>Learning Mode for Role based access – RBAC requires policy to be created to ensure that system is aware of known execution, this can be done by enabling GR-SEC in learning mode or manually updating the policy file.</p>
                    <p>Grsecurity's learning mode can be used on a per-subject or per-role basis, as well as system-wide. When using the learning mode on a single process or role, the rest of the system remains protected as defined by the policy. The learning
                        mode can learn all things that the RBAC system supports: files, capabilities, resources, what IP addresses make use of each role, and socket usage. The learning system performs intelligent reduction of filesystem and network access
                        to reduce policy size, increase readability, and reduce the amount of manual tweaking needed later. Furthermore, the learning system enforces a secure base that is configurable. Once it learning mode GR-sec will log all the activities
                        of system.</p>
                    <p>To enable full system learning, run gradm as root with the following options:</p>
                    <p>Please run few commands. In actual environment learning mode is usually 24-48 hours.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm –S
                # gradm –F –L /etc/grsec/learning.logs

                # ls
                # pwd
                # date
                # gradm –D
                # gradm –F –L /etc/grsec/learning.logs –O /etc/grsec/learning.roles</code></pre>

                    <p>You've now created a set of commands that are allowed by grsecurity. Let's now enabled grsecurity and test to see if the learned commands are allowed and all other commands are disallowed.</p>

                    <h5>Enabling Grsecurity with Learned Rules</h5>

                    <p>First backup the current policy file.</p>
                    <pre><code># cp /etc/grsec/policy /etc/grsec/policy.bak
                  # cp /etc/grsec/learning.roles /etc/grsec/policy</code></pre>

                    <p>Now enable grsecurity.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm -E</code></pre>

                    <h5>Test the Learned Rules</h5>
                    <pre><code># ls
                    # pwd
                    # cat
                    # ifconfig
                    # date

                    <p>HTTPS provides SSL encyption for all data passed between client and server. Below you will learn how to secure your Node-RED server, and all web requests to it, with HTTPS. More info can be found at <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/https.html">https://nodejs.org/api/https.html</a>                        </p>


                    <h5>Generate Certificates</h5>


                    <p>First you will generate a private key and certificate using openssl.</p>
                    <p>Make a serial connection to your Edison and enter in the following commands:</p>
                    <code>$	cd ~ </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>$ openssl req
                        -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privatekey.pem
                        -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem </code>

                    <p>Answer the prompts with your info, or hit enter to leave as blank.</p>
                    <p>you now have a private key and certificate in your home directory. </p>

                    <h5>Edit Node-RED Settings</h5>
                    <p>In order to enable HTTPS on your Node-RED server you must edit the settings file.</p>
                    <p>Edit settings.js in user Node-RED user directory:</p>
                    <code>$ vi ~/.node-red/settings.js</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <li>Hit "a" to enable editing</li>
                    <li>On line 19 remove the "//" to uncomment the line.</li>
                    <li>On lines 107-110 remove the "//" at the start of each line to uncomment the lines.</li>
                    <li>Hit Esc, type :wq, and hit enter to save and exit vi.</li>

                    <h5>Run Node-RED server</h5>
                    <p>Launch Node-RED with:</p>
                    <code>$ cd ~</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>$ node-red</code>
                    <p>Navigate to the Node-RED server in your browser at https://edison-ip:1880 , note that you must replace edison-ip with the actual ip address of your Edison.</p>

                    <p><img alt="sll warning" data-fid="504158" src="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/bd/5d/sll_warning.png" title="sll warning" typeof="foaf:Image"></p>

                    <p>Since the SSL certifiacte you are using is self signed your browser will throw a warning. Click advanced and select "Proceed to xx.xx.xx (unsafe)"</p>


                    <p><img alt="HTTPS" data-fid="504159" src="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/5c/75/https_box.png" title="HTTPS" typeof="foaf:Image"></p>
                    <p>Your Node-RED server now uses TLS 1.2 to secure the connection.</p>

                    <div class="callout done has-goto-button">
                        <p>You should now have a Node-RED HTTPS server running.</p>
