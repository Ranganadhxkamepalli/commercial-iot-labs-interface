                    <h5>Lab Overview</h5>

                    <p>The Intel Iot Gateway provides a McAfee layer that let you configure McAfee embedded products for the Wind River Linux target platform.  McAfee Embedded Control (MEC) provides the following capabilities in Wind River Linux platforms:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>code and application protection, which only lets whitelisted programs (binary executables, scripts) run.  Any program that does not appear in the whitelist cannot run.  This stops malicious programs from installing and functioning on the system.</p></li>
                        <li><p>tamper proofing for whitelisted programs so the files cannot be modified on the disk, directories or volumes</p></li>
                        <li><p>dynamic whitelisting, which eliminates the need to manually maintain the inventory list of authorized applications.  This features let you manage and update whitelisted files.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>explore how MEC manages the inventory of executables, configurations, operation modes and logging.</p></li>
                        <li><p>enable McAfee embedded control</p></li>
                        <li><p>observe how the MEC code and application protection features work</p></li>
                        <li><p>verify the MEC write/read protection feature</p></li>
                        <li><p>use MEC update mode</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>1. Exploring McAfee Embedded Control</h5>

                    <p>In this section you will explore how McAfee embedded control integrates into Wind River Linux and how MEC manages the inventory of executables, configurations, operating modes and logging.</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>
                            <p>On the Intel Iot Gateway, open a terminal window and execute the following command to confirm that the MEC RPM is installed:</p>
                            <pre><code># rpm -qa | egrep solidcore
solidcores3-6.6.0_145-r0.0.intel_baytrail_64
                            </code></pre>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Execute the the following command to display the help menu:</p>
                            <p><code>sadmin help</code></p>
                            <p><img src="./views/labs/security/mec/image_0.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Execute the following command to review the list of all application control features and their status (enabled or disabled).</p>
                            <p><code>sadmin features</code></p>
                            <p><img src="./views/labs/security/mec/image_1.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
                            <p>Note the following aspect of the MEC features:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>The feature <strong>script-auth</strong> is like deny-exec, but for scripts - only whitelisted scripts file can execute.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The feature <strong>deny-write</strong> providers tamper-proofing to protect data file ( for example configuration file).  Unlike the deny-exec and script-auth features (which rely on a whitelist), the deny-write feature is rules-based.  The MEC configuration file (solidcore.conf) records the rules.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The feature <strong>deny-read</strong> provides tamper-proofing to prevent reading of critical files.  The feature <strong>deny-read</strong> is alos rule based (like deny-write) - The MEC configuration file (solidcore.conf) records the rules.  The feature is disabled by default.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The feature <strong>integrity</strong> protects MEC data and file from modification , renaming or deletion.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>As the MEC administrators, execute the following command to check the status of the McAfee embedded control on your target:</p>
                            <p><code>sadmin status</code><p>
                                <p><img src="./views/labs/security/mec/image_2.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
                                <p>Observe that the status is Unsolidified.</p>

                                <p>The following table describes the fields and their meaning.</p>

                    <h5>2. Enabling McAfee Embedded Control</h5>

                    <p>In this section you will generate an initial whitelist, enable MEC, and restart the McAfee solidifier service.</p>

                    <p>Dynamic whitelisting is a core feature of MEC.  The whitelist (or inventory) enumerates the set of programs (called authorized or solidified program code) that are allowed to run on the host computer.  Any programs not in the whitelist are considered unauthorized - they cannot execute, and MEC logs their failed attempt to execute.  Whitelisting does not change the files listed in the inventory.</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>
                            <p>As the MEC administrator, execute the following command to create the initial whitelist.</p>
                            <p><code>sadmin solidify /bin /boot /etc /lib /lib64 /opt /root /sbin /usr /www</code></p>
                            <p>This command may take a few minutes to complete.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>As the MEC administrator, execute the following command to confirm that MEC created the initial whitelist.  The application control component stores a whitelist for each volume at volume<strong>/.solidcore/scinv</strong></p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Execute the following command to check the status of McAfee embedded control.</p>
                            <p><img src="./views/labs/security/mec/image_5.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
                            <p>Observe that the status of the ext3 drive has changed to Solidified.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>As the MEC administrator, execute the following command to enable MEC.</p>
                            <p><code>sadmin enable</code></p>
                            <p>McAfee Solidifier will be enabled on service restart.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>As the MEC admin, execute this command to restart the McAfee service</p>
                            <p><code>systemctl restart scsrvc</code></p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Execute the following command to verify that MEC is enabled.</p>

                    <h5>3. Verifying MEC Code and Application Protection</h5>

                    <p>In this section you will create a script and observe how MEC code and application protection works.</p>

                    <p>MEC only lets whitelisted programs (binaries, executables, or scripts) run - any program not in the whitelist cannot run.</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>
                            <p>Create the script by typing</p>
                            <p><code># vi /root/test_script.sh</code></p>
                            <p>Type "i" to enter insert mode and then type</p>
                            <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World"
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>Then press "ESC" and type “:wq”  This will save and quit the vi editor.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
	                          <p>Give the script execute permissions</p>
	                          <p><code>$ chmod +x /root/test_script.sh</code></p>
	                          <p>Then try to execute the script.</p>
                            <p><img src="./views/labs/security/mec/image_8.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

                    <h5>5. Using the Update Mode</h5>

                    <p>In this section you will use MEC update mode to update the file /root/test_script.sh which is write and read protected.</p>

                    <p>When MEC is in update mode it allows all changes on a protected system.  You can use update mode to complete maintenance tasks, such as installing patches or upgrading software and data files.</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>
                            <p>Type this command to cause MEC to go into update mode.</p>

                    <h5>Lab Overview</h5>

                    <p><b>GRSecurity</b> is a set of software patches released under the GNU GPL for the Linux kernel to enhance the system security. It allows the system administrator to, among other things, define a minimum privilege policy for the system, in which every process and user have only the lowest privileges necessary to function. GRSecurity has 2 primary features, the RBAC (Rules Based Access Control) and the PaX.</p>
                    <p><b>gradm</b>, the administration utility for the role-based access control system, is a powerful tool that parses your ACLs (Access Control Lists), performs the enforcement of a secure base policy, optimizes the ACLs, as well as handles parsing of the learning logs, merges them with your ACL set and outputs the final ACLs.</p>
                    

                    <h5>Disable McAfee Embedded Control</h5>

                    <p>By design, <b>McAfee Embedded Control</b> will protect your system from changes. So let's turn it off now.</p> 
                    <pre><code># sadmin disable</code></pre>

                    <h5>The gradm command</h5>
                    <p>gradm is the grsecurity RBAC administration and policy analysis utility. It allows you to configure and administrate the grsecurity system.</p>
                    <p>To display all available command-line switches, run gradm --help.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm</code></pre>
                    <img src="./views/labs/security/grsecurity/gr1.png"></img>


                    <h5>Setting up a Role-Based Access</h5>
                    <p>Here we will create three roles <b>root</b>, <b>admin</b>, <b>shutdown</b>. Each of these roles will have unique abilities that will be constrained by the by RBAC. You can use any password that you like for each role.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm -P</code></pre>
                    <img src="./views/labs/security/grsecurity/gr0.png"/>

                    <img src="./views/labs/security/grsecurity/gr3.png"/>

                    <h5>Enable Learning Mode</h5>
                    <p>Learning Mode for Role based access – RBAC requires policy to be created to ensure that system is aware of known execution, this can be done by enabling GR-SEC in learning mode or manually updating the policy file.</p>
                    <p>Grsecurity's learning mode can be used on a per-subject or per-role basis, as well as system-wide. When using the learning mode on a single process or role, the rest of the system remains protected as defined by the policy. The learning mode can learn all things that the RBAC system supports: files, capabilities, resources, what IP addresses make use of each role, and socket usage. The learning system performs intelligent reduction of filesystem and network access to reduce policy size, increase readability, and reduce the amount of manual tweaking needed later. Furthermore, the learning system enforces a secure base that is configurable.  Once it learning mode GR-sec will log all the activities of system.</p>
                    <p>To enable full system learning, run gradm as root with the following options:</p>
                    <p>Please run few commands. In actual environment learning mode is usually 24-48 hours.</p>
                    <pre><code># gradm –S
# gradm –F –L /etc/grsec/learning.logs</code></pre>

                    # ls
                    # pwd
                    # date
                    # gradm –D
                    # gradm –F –L /etc/grsec/learning.logs –O /etc/grsec/learning.roles</code></pre>
                            <img src="./views/labs/security/grsecurity/gr4.png"/>

                            <p>You've now created a set of commands that are allowed by grsecurity. Let's now enabled grsecurity and test to see if the learned commands are allowed and all other commands are disallowed.</p>

                            <h5>Enabling Grsecurity with Learned Rules</h5>

                            <p>First backup the current policy file.</p>
                            <pre><code># cp /etc/grsec/policy /etc/grsec/policy.bak
# cp /etc/grsec/learning.roles /etc/grsec/policy</code></pre>

                            <p>Now enable grsecurity.</p>
                            <pre><code># gradm -E</code></pre>

                            <h5>Test the Learned Rules</h5>
                            <pre><code># ls
# pwd
# cat
# ifconfig
# date
# gradm -D</code></pre>
