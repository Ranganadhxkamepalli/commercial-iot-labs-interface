          <labels gateway arduino windows/>
          <p>The labs in the Intel Commercial IoT Workshop are build in a progression which will result in each attendee building their own automated and secured, multi-device IoT network.</p>

          <p>The set of labs start with a basic introduction to the Intel IoT Gateway.  From there, we will begin to build a complete and deployable IoT architecture based on Intel technology.</p>

          <p>The next steps will include experimenting with <b>sensors and actuators</b> from the Grove IoT Development Kit, setting up a database that will store sensor data on the edge network, install a customized user interface that administrators can use to monitor edge network activity, integrate with the Helix Device Cloud for enterprise manageablity and administration.  We will then use Intel Security tools to lock down the gateway and ready it for deployment.  Finally, we look at integration with 3rd party cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, GE Predix, Amazon AWS and IBM BlueMix.</p>
